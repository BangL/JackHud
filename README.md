# JackHud
JackHud is a fork of GageHud.
I was actually up to do pretty much the same as cjur3, which was combining Seven's codes into one nice package with settings and all that... but then i found this, so why start a complete new core, when there already is a nice start available?
However.. i am not down with some originally included features of GageHud, so instead of pushing some "remove bla feature" pull requests it's probably making more sense to make a fork.

###Features are:
* HUD Tab Stats
* HUD Panel Lists
* Pacified Civilian Markers
* Numerical Suspicion
* Numerical interaction countdown
* Reload interaction circle
* Down Counter / Detection risk indicator
* Kill-Counters
* Flashlight Extender
* Save/Load Preplanning
* Screen Skipping
* Anti accidentally throwing grenades in stealth
* Enhanced Assault Banner
* Some graphical tweaks
* Ingame-voice indicators
* Stamina Meter
* Push to Interact
* Force enable/disable showing of weapon skins in lobby
* Buy all assets
* Armor/Inspire timers
* Laser options
* HPS Meters
* contract broker quick link
* and more...

###Planned/Suggestions
* writing this list
* alot ...

###Contribution and BugFixes
Create a pull request and I will look into it.
