# JackHud
JackHud is a fork of GageHud.
I was actually up to do pretty much the same as cjur3, which was combining Seven's codes into one nice package with settings and all that... but then i found this, so why start a complete new core, when there already is a nice start available?
However.. i am not down with some originally included features of GageHud, so instead of pushing some "remove bla feature" pull requests it's probably making more sense to make a fork.
Whenever i fix or improve something of the original code i will try to create proper pull requests to push it upstream.

###Features are:
* Hud-StatsScreen
* DynamicHud
* Percentage HudSuspicion
* Kill-Counter
* Flashlight Extender
* Bullet Decapitations
* Preplanned
* And many more...

###Suggestions
* writing this list
* alot ...

###Contribution and BugFixes
Create a pull request and I will look into it.

####Big Credit to Seven, cjur3, thatguyfrombreakingbad, UndeadSewer, YandereSnake and the entire modding community. If I forgot to credit somebody, please let me know
